#### _Amazon Leadership Principle_
### Are Right, A Lot

Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.

---

### Use tenative language. Hedge.

'I think that X may be better than Y because' vs 'X is better than Y'

---

### Admit you're wrong quickly

You'll appear to be right more often
